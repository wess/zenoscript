# Zenoscript 0.1.4: Security Enhancements and Code Quality Improvements

*Published: June 30, 2025*

We're excited to announce **Zenoscript 0.1.4**, a focused release that significantly improves the security and code quality of the Zenoscript transpiler and CLI tools. This release addresses important security vulnerabilities while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## üîí Security Improvements

### Eliminated eval() Usage

The biggest change in 0.1.4 is the complete removal of unsafe `eval()` calls from the REPL and inline execution features. Previously, the CLI used `eval()` to execute transpiled TypeScript code, which posed security risks.

**Before (0.1.3):**
```typescript
// Unsafe eval() usage
const result = eval(wrappedCode);
```

**After (0.1.4):**
```typescript
// Safe file-based execution
const tempFile = `/tmp/zenoscript_inline_${Date.now()}.ts`;
await Bun.write(tempFile, typescript);
const result = await import(tempFile);
```

This change eliminates the security vulnerabilities associated with `eval()` while maintaining the same functionality for users.

### Impact on Features

- **REPL (`zeno repl`)**: Now uses temporary file execution instead of eval
- **Inline execution (`zeno -e "code"`)**: Safer execution model with proper cleanup
- **Performance**: Minimal impact while significantly improving security posture

## üßπ Code Quality Enhancements

### Biome Linting Integration

We've integrated [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) as our primary linting tool and fixed all existing code quality issues:

- **Fixed style violations**: Proper block statements and template literal usage
- **Removed unused parameters**: Clean function signatures throughout the codebase
- **Consistent code formatting**: Improved readability and maintainability

### Test Coverage Maintained

All 53 existing tests continue to pass, ensuring that security improvements don't break existing functionality:

```bash
‚úì 53 tests passed
‚úì 0 tests failed
‚úì 152 assertions completed successfully
```

## ‚ú® Enhanced Language Features

### Optional Parentheses for Function Calls

Building on Elixir-inspired syntax, Zenoscript 0.1.4 includes refined support for **optional parentheses** in function calls, making your code more concise and readable:

```zenoscript
// Traditional function calls with parentheses
console.log("Hello World")
processValue(42)
myFunction("hello world")

// Compiles to clean TypeScript:
console.log("Hello World");
processValue(42);
myFunction("hello world");
```

**Smart keyword detection** ensures control flow statements remain unaffected:

```zenoscript
// Keywords are preserved correctly
if x == 1 { return value }

// Compiles to:
if (x == 1) { return value }
```

### Optional Return Statements

Functions automatically return their last expression, eliminating boilerplate `return` keywords:

```zenoscript
// Concise function definitions
function add(a, b) { a + b }
const multiply = (x, y) => { x * y }

// Multi-statement functions with automatic return
function processData(input) { 
  let cleaned = input |> trim |> toLowerCase
  let validated = validateInput(cleaned)
  validated.result  // Automatically returned
}
```

**Compiles to TypeScript with explicit returns:**

```typescript
function add(a, b) { return a + b }
const multiply = (x, y) => { return x * y }

function processData(input) { 
  const cleaned = ((input).trim()).toLowerCase();
  const validated = validateInput(cleaned);
  return validated.result;
}
```

### Improved Pattern Recognition

The transpiler now better handles edge cases and complex expressions while preserving the intent of your code.

## üöÄ What's Preserved

### Full Backward Compatibility

All existing Zenoscript code continues to work exactly as before. The enhanced language features are additions that don't break existing syntax.

### Performance Characteristics

The transpiler performance remains unchanged, with security improvements having minimal overhead on execution speed.

### Core Language Features

All established Zenoscript features work identically:
- Pattern matching with atoms
- Pipe operations  
- Struct and trait definitions
- TypeScript integration

## üõ† Development Infrastructure

### Enhanced Development Workflow

The security improvements make Zenoscript safer for developers to work with:

```bash
# REPL is now completely safe
zeno repl

# Inline execution uses secure temporary files
zeno -e "let x = 42; x |> console.log"

# All existing functionality preserved
zeno init my-project
```

### Improved Error Handling

Better error reporting in the secure execution model helps developers debug issues more effectively.

## üì¶ Installation and Upgrade

### Upgrading from 0.1.3

Upgrade to 0.1.4 using your preferred method:

```bash
# Using Bun (recommended)
bun install -g zenoscript@0.1.4

# Using install script
curl -fsSL https://zeno.run/install.sh | bash
```

### Verification

Confirm you're running 0.1.4:

```bash
zeno --version
# Output: Zenoscript v0.1.4
```

## üîÆ Looking Ahead

### ZenoVM Architecture Progress

While this release focuses on security, we continue development on the **ZenoVM** multi-target compilation system that will enable Zenoscript to compile to multiple backend languages (C, Go, WebAssembly) beyond TypeScript.

### Upcoming Features

Future releases will focus on:
- Enhanced pattern matching capabilities
- Performance optimizations in the transpiler
- Extended standard library
- Better IDE integration
- Additional compilation targets
